![3D printer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kndndrj/renew3d/master/images/photo_1.jpg)

A simple 3D printer made with common and cheap parts. During my many years of playing around with
printers, I settled on something clean, simple and reliable.

I want it to sit in the basement and be ready to print in a few minutes,
without needing to spend too much time configuring parameters
